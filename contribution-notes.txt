Part 1:
We called, planned the assignment, and delegated
Jesse coded DELETE
Max coded GET
Alyssa coded PUT

After we worked on each part, we reviewed them together and decided on a singular style

We all helped fixed bugs for part one

Part 2:
Jesse wrote most of the forwarding code
Max did most of the bugging

Other items:
Alyssa wrote contribution notes, members, Dockerfile
We all tested the code on our own machines
